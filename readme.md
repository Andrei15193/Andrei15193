## Andrei15193's profile

Hey, how's it going? Hopefully all is good and if not, what is life without a little challenge?

I'm a software developer since 2013, that's when I got my first job, starting with .NET and SQL
for the first 6 years and afterwards added ReactJS to my toolbelt, some DevOps here and there.

I do pet projects apart from what I'm doing at work. I like to have control over what I learn
rather than wait for a project where I can learn what I am interested in. Obviously, I wouldn't
be able to apply what I learn at the level of a multi-person project with allocated time, but
it does provide useful experience later on to help the work project out. I've done this already
on multiple occasions.

Besides software development, I read books, mostly non-fiction, related to psychology or
phylosophy. The two go hand in hand to a certain degree. Watch TV shows (_Pickle Rick.. YEAH!_),
and movies when I get the time.

I am maintaining two open-source projects, one of the is [react-model-view-viewmodel](https://github.com/Andrei15193/react-model-view-viewmodel)
and the other is [CodeMap](https://github.com/Andrei15193/CodeMap) along side an associated project [EmbeddedResourceBrowser](https://github.com/Andrei15193/EmbeddedResourceBrowser) for it. If you are interested, check them out.

If you want to collaborate or reach out to me, you can look me up on the various social media platforms,
if it's something more professional use LinkedIn, otherwise you can send an e-mail or reach out on
Facebook or Discord (yes, I am intentionally not leaving any links to these here, you'll have to use
your search skills).
